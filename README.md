### Simulator.
You can download the Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```



# Project Implementation

## Results
The result of the simulation of the developed path planing simulation algorithm is shown in this [Video(link)](https://youtu.be/sqHvWyzVVqE)

## Finite State Machine
The way the presented path planner performs decisions about how to drive in the highway is through a finite state machine consisting of only 3 states:

* Keep Lane
* Lane Change Right
* Lane Change Left

### Transitions
Transitions between these states are handled by using the following weighted cost functions:

* Goal Lane speed
* Goal Lane free space (depending distance to next car)
* Crash cost (when switching lanes it depends on the distance to the proximate vehicles in front and behind ur vehicle on the goal lane).
* Center cost. This cost function returns cero when the vehicle is moving on the central lane and a constant value when it is not.

## Trajectory generations
In order to generate trajectories that perform  each one of the state's actions. i.e. keep the lane, change lane right or change lane left, [splines](http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/) are used.

In the case of the ttrajectories for lane changing, a set of 5 trajectories is calculated, so that we have 5 options from which we can choose the best trajectory for lane change. This decision is based on the accumulate of the distance of each point of the trajectory to the nearest vehicles, we choose the trajectory with the smallest accumulate of distances.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.
